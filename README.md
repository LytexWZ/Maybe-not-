<pre>
Because you got C1 english level this shouldn't be a problem, should be?


So you are here, you decided to trust.

Interesting... 


  

After watching the video you were redirected here for a simple reason, I don't have money to host a 
webpage so, here it is, the APK file you need to download. After installing it you are going to be able to see the rest.


  
Good luck

- 2 Once the download has finished, go to your chrome downloads folder

- 3 Click on the recent downloaded file to install it
- 4 Now we got 2 possible scenarios, aplication has been installed so you only need to open it
- 5 Or aplication wasn't installed because of permissions, in this case we are going to grant the permissions:
